# Voice-Navigation-System
Voice Navigation System (VNS) is a Artificial Intelligence (AI) based Windows Speech Synthesis system that understands human voice and implements those commands on the operating system. VNS was initially developed in May 2002 by Computer Science Engineering students of Visvesvaraya Technological University, under my guidance. This became award winning powerful project, securing 1st position among all project submissions. The project was made in Visual Basic 6 along Microsoft Speech SDK. Now the code is being made open in the public domain. Enjoy playing with it !
